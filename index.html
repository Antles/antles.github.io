                <h4>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h4>
                <p><strong>Narrative:</strong></p>
                <h4>1. Artifact Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The original artifact I am enhancing is a native Android application for inventory management, which
                    I created for my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The application was developed
                    using Java and Android's native UI toolkit with XML layouts. It functions as a self-contained,
                    single-user tool, where all application components — user interface, business logic, and data
                    storage via a local SQLite database — are bundled together in a monolithic architecture. It allows a
                    user to create an account, log in, and perform all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                    operations on inventory items stored directly on the device.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Justification for Inclusion and Enhancement</h4>
                <p>
                    I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it serves as a perfect "before" picture,
                    representing a familiar and well-understood software architecture (the monolith) that is functional
                    but has apparent, demonstrable limitations. Its primary weakness is its structure; being a
                    self-contained unit, it cannot support multiple users, cannot be accessed from different platforms
                    (like the web), and is not scalable. This makes it an ideal candidate for a significant and
                    practical enhancement that showcases a wide range of modern software engineering skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities are found in the enhancement itself.
                    The artifact was improved by completely re-engineering its backend architecture. I have decomposed
                    the monolith into a modern client-server model by creating a robust, standalone backend service
                    using the Go programming language (Golang). This new API now serves as the central authority for all
                    business logic and data manipulation. The Go code demonstrates my ability to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure a professional web service with a clear separation of concerns (main entry point,
                        database logic, request handlers).</li>
                    <li>Handle HTTP requests and responses, process JSON data, and interact with a database securely and
                        efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Implement a clean RESTful API with logical endpoints for all CRUD operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This enhancement demonstrates my ability to analyze an existing system, identify its architectural
                    flaws, and design a superior solution utilizing industry-standard practices and modern tools.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Course Outcome Alignment</h4>
                <p>
                    This enhancement directly aligns with the course outcomes I planned to achieve in Module One. There
                    are no updates to my outcome-coverage plan.

                        demonstration of this outcome. I evaluated the original monolithic design and identified its
                        trade-offs (simplicity vs. lack of scalability). I then designed a new client-server solution
                        that aligns with current computer science practices and standards. This new architecture
                        addresses the original problem of inventory management in a scalable, accessible, and secure

                        performance and concurrency. The technique of building a RESTful API to serve a decoupled
                        frontend is the foundation of most modern web services. This enhancement delivers immense value
                        by transforming a single-user mobile utility into a platform-agnostic service capable of
                        supporting a real business.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>4. Reflection on the Process</h4>
                <p>
                    The process of enhancing this artifact was an incredibly valuable learning experience that forced me
                    to shift my entire development perspective. The most significant challenge was transitioning from
                    the mindset of a mobile developer, where everything exists in a single, contained environment, to
                    that of a backend developer, where you are building a stateless service that must be secure,
                    efficient, and reliable. Learning to structure a Go application, managing dependencies with go mod,
                    and setting up a router for handling API endpoints was a steep but rewarding learning curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned most profoundly was the importance of defining a clear API contract before writing
                    the bulk of the logic. Deciding precisely what each endpoint would be (/api/v1/items,
                    /api/v1/items/{id), what HTTP method it would use (GET, POST, PUT), and what the JSON structure for
                    requests and responses would look like was a critical planning step. This made the actual coding of
                    the handler functions much more straightforward because I had a clear blueprint to follow. Another
                    major challenge was correctly setting up the PostgreSQL database and managing user permissions. I
                    faced several "permission denied" errors. Overcoming this taught me that database security isn't
                    just about the application code; it extends to proper administration of the database server itself.
                    This process solidified my understanding of how different parts of a complex software system
                    communicate and has given me a much stronger foundation in software architecture and design that I
                    will carry with me into my career.

                <h4>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h4>
                <p><strong>Narrative:</strong></p>
                <h4>1. Artifact Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The original artifact I am enhancing is the data retrieval logic from my Android inventory
                    management application, created in CS 360. In its initial form, the application's approach to data
                    structures and algorithms was rudimentary. The primary data operation was a single, inflexible
                    method, getAllInventoryItems, which executed a hardcoded SELECT * SQL query. The result was loaded
                    into a Java ArrayList, a basic linear data structure. This meant that to display or find any
                    information, the entire dataset had to be loaded into the client device's memory first, with no
                    efficient means of searching or sorting provided by the backend logic.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Justification for Inclusion and Enhancement</h4>
                <p>
                    I selected this artifact because its initial implementation represents a common but inefficient
                    approach to data handling that is not scalable. It provides a clear opportunity to demonstrate my
                    understanding of algorithmic efficiency and the importance of server-side data processing. The
                    original method's O(n) complexity for any search operation (where 'n' represents the total number of
                    items) and its high memory usage make it a prime candidate for significant algorithmic enhancement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artifact was improved by implementing a sophisticated, server-side dynamic search and sorting
                    algorithm within the Go backend. This new algorithm, exposed via the /api/v1/items/search endpoint,
                    showcases several key skills:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Design:</strong> The core of the enhancement is the searchItemsHandler
                        function. This algorithm intelligently constructs a SQL query string by dynamically appending
                        WHERE and ORDER BY clauses based on optional user-provided parameters. This is a far more
                        complex and efficient approach than fetching all the data at once.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structure Manipulation:</strong> The algorithm uses a slice of interfaces
                        ([]interface{}) to collect and pass parameters to the database driver safely. This technique is
                        crucial for creating secure prepared statements and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency and Scalability:</strong> By offloading the work of filtering and sorting to
                        the PostgreSQL database engine (which can use indexes for searches closer to O(log n)
                        complexity), the algorithm ensures that the client application remains fast and responsive,
                        regardless of the size of the inventory.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Course Outcome Alignment</h4>
                <p>
                    This enhancement directly meets the course outcome I planned in Module One:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic
                            principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while
                            managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</strong> This enhancement is a direct
                        application of the algorithmic tenets to solve the problem of efficiently finding specific data
                        within a large dataset. I evaluated the original client-side iteration approach and identified
                        its poor performance as a key trade-off. My new server-side algorithm is a standard computer
                        science practice that strikes the correct balance: it increases backend complexity in exchange
                        for a significant improvement in client-side performance, network efficiency, and overall
                        application scalability.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>4. Reflection on the Process</h4>
                <p>
                    Enhancing this artifact was a challenging and highly educational process that moved me from simply
                    retrieving data to intelligently processing it. The biggest challenge was determining how to
                    construct a SQL query dynamically in a manner that was both flexible and secure. My initial thought
                    was to use simple string concatenation to build the entire query, but I quickly learned through
                    research that this method is wide open to SQL injection attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key thing I learned was the importance of prepared statements and how to use them with a dynamic
                    number of parameters. The solution was to build the query structure with placeholders (such as $1,
                    $2) and separately create a list (a slice in Go) of the actual values. This separation ensures that
                    user input is treated as data, not as executable code, which was a significant "aha!" moment for me
                    in understanding backend security. I also faced the challenge of handling multiple optional
                    parameters gracefully. The series of if statements in my searchItemsHandler, which checks if a
                    parameter exists before adding it to the query and the arguments list, is a direct result of that
                    challenge. This process taught me that designing a good algorithm isn't just about the logic; it's
                    also about anticipating edge cases and writing defensive, secure code.

                <h4>Enhancement 3: Databases</h4>
                <p><strong>Narrative:</strong></p>
                <h4>1. Artifact Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The original artifact I am enhancing is the database component of my Android inventory management
                    application, which was created for my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. A local,
                    file-based SQLite database handled the application's data persistence. This database was embedded
                    within the application itself, meaning each installation had its own isolated data file. The schema
                    was simple, and critically, it stored user passwords in plain text, representing a significant
                    security flaw. This approach, while functional for a single-user offline prototype, is fundamentally
                    unsuitable for a real-world system that requires data integrity, security, and shared access.
                </p>

                <h4>2. Justification for Inclusion and Enhancement</h4>
                <p>
                    I selected this artifact because its database implementation provides a clear and compelling
                    opportunity to demonstrate growth in two critical areas: database architecture and security. The
                    migration from SQLite to a server-based system showcases my understanding of scalable data
                    solutions, but the most important enhancement is the implementation of proper security practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The artifact was improved by migrating the data layer to PostgreSQL and, more significantly, by
                    implementing a secure user authentication system. The specific components that showcase my skills
                    and abilities are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Database Schema Enhancement:</strong> I designed and created a new users table in
                        PostgreSQL with appropriate constraints, including a UNIQUE constraint on the username to ensure
                        data integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Password Storage:</strong> The core of this enhancement is in the auth.go and
                        auth_handlers.go files. I implemented functions to securely hash user passwords using the
                        industry-standard bcrypt algorithm before storing them. The HashPassword function creates a
                        secure hash, and the CheckPasswordHash function provides a safe way to verify a login attempt
                        without ever exposing the original password. This demonstrates a proactive security mindset.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication Logic:</strong> I built API endpoints for user registration and login
                        that correctly handle the flow of data, from validating user input to interacting with the
                        database and securely comparing password hashes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Course Outcome Alignment</h4>
                <p>
                    This enhancement directly aligns with the course outcome I planned to achieve in Module One. There
                    are no updates to my outcome-coverage plan.

                        my enhancement. I identified the critical vulnerability of storing plain-text passwords in the
                        original artifact. I then mitigated this design flaw completely by implementing bcrypt hashing.
                        This directly anticipates a common adversarial exploit (a database breach) and ensures that even
                        if the data were compromised, user passwords would remain secure and private, thus protecting
                        user data.</p>

                <p>
                    The process of implementing this enhancement was incredibly insightful and solidified my
                    understanding of backend security. The biggest challenge was not just learning how to use the bcrypt
                    library, but understanding why it is so important. It forced me to think like an adversary and
                    consider the potential consequences of a data breach. This shifted my perspective from just "making
                    login work" to "building a secure authentication system."

                    One of the key things I learned was the practical difference between encoding, encryption, and
                    one-way hashing. I now understand that hashing is the correct tool for password security because you
                    should never need to decrypt a password, only verify it. I also faced the challenge of structuring
                    the new authentication code in a clean and efficient manner. My solution was to create separate
                    auth.go and auth_handlers.go files. This separated the pure cryptographic utility functions (such as
                    HashPassword) from the HTTP request handling logic (such as RegisterHandler). This separation of
                    concerns made the code much cleaner, easier to read, and more maintainable. This process has
                    fundamentally changed how I will approach any feature involving user data in the future; security
                    will no longer be an afterthought but a foundational requirement from the very beginning of the
                    design process.
